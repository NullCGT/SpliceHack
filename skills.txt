Flaming Fists
    Flaming fists allows the user to set enemies on fire using their unarmed
    strikes. This increases damage dealt by 1d6 and may destroy potions in the
    defender's inventory.

    The chance of this effect activating on a given attack is skill_level / 20.
Freezing Fists
    Flaming fists allows the user to  deal cold damage to enemies using their 
    unarmed strikes. This increases damage dealt by 1d6 and may destroy potions
    in the defender's inventory.

    The chance of this effect activating on a given attack is skill_level / 25.
Shocking Fists
    Shocking fists allows the user to  deal electric damage to enemies using their 
    unarmed strikes. This increases damage dealt by 1d20 and may destroy wands
    in the defender's inventory.

    The chance of this effect activating on a given attack is skill_level / 100.
Sneak Attack
    Sneak attack increases the damage the user deals when attacking from behind,
    or, if the user is not a rogue, gives them the ability to backstab. Maximum
    backstab damage is multiplied by one plus the skill level.
Stunning Fist
    Stunning fist increases the chances of stunning a monster with unarmed
    attacks, provided the user already had the ability to do so.


IDEAS
- Healer: Chance to probe monster when attacking.
- Healer: Heal enemies with unarmed strikes.
- Ranger: Favored enemy (gain bonus damage).
- Ranger: Beastmaster (tame animals).
- Knight/Samurai: Code of Law. Increases penalty for breaking code, in exchange for... something?
- Knight: Demon hunter. Like favored enemy, but for demons. Possibly know all demons?
- Knight: Armored mage. Decreases spellcasting penalty, in exchange for... something?
- Wizard/Cleric: Blood Magic. Cast from HP.
- Humans get no skills. Instead, they get extra skill slots.
- Potentially being in the dark is the same as being blind? That would make elves more interesting,
  certainly, and also turn light sources into a time limit...
- Wizard: Wild Magic. Spells have a chance of doing random things.
- Orc: Blood Rage. Gain bonuses to attack when below half health.
- Orc: Raging Clarity. Gain bonuses to spellcasting when below half health.

ARCHEOLOGIST IDEAS
- Panache: Provides a passive bonus to luck.
- Dueling: Provides an attack bonus as long as the player is attacking with a one-handed weapon and
           wielding no shield.
