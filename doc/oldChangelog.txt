@@@ file up for posterity.                @@@
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                            Version 0.8.3

New Materials
- Slime
  - Gelatinous armor can grow and shrink with the player when they polymorph instead of breaking or
    falling off.
  - Gelatinous weapons have -4 damage, and are generally terrible.
  - Sludge golems drop gelatinous items and green slime.

New Artifacts
- Lenses of Death Perception
  - As long as the wearer is not blind, they deal double damage, but constantly hallucinate.
  - Grants searching.

Dungeon
- Added Dudley on level one of the dungeon. Dudley is a tutorial character that explains the nature
  of SpliceHack and can give the player tips.
- Added a minetown variant (Zootown), from SporkHack/EvilHack.
- Added an original minetown variant (Lavender Town).
- Replaced the Eternal Storm with a new, more exciting plane: The Plane of Ice.
  - Flying and levitation are impossible.
  - Icebergs float through the level. The player must move from iceberg to iceberg to move forward.
- Replaced the Gemstone Array's map with a new, more exciting variant.
  - The gemstone array is a standard corridor maze, but with a twist: The maze changes over time.
    this is made possible by the changing mazes patch by Pasi Kallinen.
  - Digging in the gemstone array can create crystal golems.
- Added holiday-themed fruit names from xNetHack. It's an excellent feature with great inclusivity.

Balance
- When a monster activates a polytrap, there is a 1 in 7 chance that the polytrap is removed.
  This is to prevent abuse of the new methods of taming monsters in order to create an army of
  powerful pets.
- Pets that are not immune to disintegration will not attack spheres of the void.
- Monster cards transform when exposed to water, rather than fading.

Miscelaneous
- The SpliceHack splash screen in curses mode is now rainbow!
- Updated therecmdmenu and herecmdmenu to be more helpful.
- Increase damage for mhitm and uhitm with quills.
- Magic cancellation does not affect AD_CALM messages.
- Increased probability of luck damaging melee attacks succeeding.
- Monster disarm attack chance is now unaffected by magic cancellation. The frequency of disarming
  was dropped to compensate.
- Monsters attacking in melee with potion effect attacks (i.e. shambling horrors) do no damage
  when splashing potions on the player.
- Increased chance that ice devils will inflict fumbling.
- Refactored order that knockback attack effects occur in, hopefully preventing future bugs.
- Improve messages for buzzsaw traps.
- Banshees are a valid polymorph form.
- Decks of cards generate in barracks (RojjaCebolla)

Bug Fixes
- Cancelled molydei cannot polymorph other monsters.
- Improve consistency of YAFMs for bears caught in bear traps.
- Fixed dragonmaster quest leader being randomly hostile.
- Fixed unicorn horn dipping.

                            Version 0.8.2

Balance
- Improved ghoul playability
  - Ghouls can eat tins. They discard spinach, but can eat all other tins without risk of sickness.
  - When playing as a ghoul, all corpses rot at a consistent rate.
    Edible corpses are denoted by the prefix "rotting".
    - This should fix one of the most annoying parts of playing as a ghoul: Hoping that your corpses
      are old enough to eat. Additionally, it fixes the exploit of repeatedly trying to eat a corpse
      until the RNG decides it is just rotted enough for you to do so.
  - Refined the starting inventory of ghouls so they get less useless objects.
    - More specifically, ghouls cannot start with rings of poison resistance, and food rations are
      replaced by tins.
  - Ghouls take a -2 penalty to strength and dexterity while satiated.
- From xNetHack: It is no longer possible to gain see invisible intrinsically. All sources
  of intrinsic see invisible eventually time out.
- From xNetHack: Melee combat wakes up nearby monsters.

QOL
- The sparkle animation that plays when monsters step on fire traps is automatically disabled
  on the plane of fire and city of brass.
- Wear pumpkins with 'W' (entrez)
- Start of game displays orientation (entrez)
- Improved deck of cards and deck of fate feedback (entrez)
- Improve amulet of change functionality (entrez)

Miscelaneous
- War's sword displays a message if a species goes extinct while it is held.
- Goristros resist fire.
- Gnomish psychics resist psychic damage.
- Oiled weapons always lose thier oil after a single strike, and no longer cause explosions.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed improper skill attribution for two-weaponing.
- Fixed ghouls getting less powerful when weak.
- Prevent banquet hall chest from spawning inside a wall.
- Fixed a bug where using credit for shopkeeper services could cause issues.
- Prevent extraplanar merchants from dying to fumaroles in the city of brass.
- Prevent archons from going extinct due to sin spawning during a fallen angel ascension.
- Fix monsters not gaining telepathy from items that should grant it.
- Fixed Yeenoghu entrance typo.
- Fixed object weight not updating when material was warped.
- Fixed poison and potion dips not affecting weapons the way they should.


                            Version 0.8.2

Bug Fixes
- Fixed some minor window naming in the windows release.
- Added a pull request by entrez to fix gender naming monsters in special levels.
- Fixed riding mark only appearing when pilemark was enabled.

                            Version 0.8.0

New Items
- Chakram
  - Originally from DNetHack.
- Scabbard
  - Base item type for Avalon.
- Frag Grenade
- Gas Grenade
  - From SLASH'EM.
  - The following monsters have grenades:
    - Captain: 50/50 chance of a gas or frag grenade.
    - Watch Captain: 50/50 chance of a gas or frag grenade.
    - One-Eyed Sam: 3 gas grenades.
    - Orcish Warlord: 1 frag grenade.
    - All Pirates: 1/2 chance of a frag grenade.
    - All Mercernaries: 1/6 chance of a random grenade.

- Auto shotgun
- Submachine gun
- Heavy machine gun
- Rifle
- Sniper rifle
- Shotgun shell
- Bullet
  - Ported a subset of firearms form SLASH'EM.
  - Shopkeepers are equipped with shotguns.
  - A few differences:
    - You can hear distant gunfire.
    - Soldiers do not spawn with guns.
    - Monsters will attempt to use pistols, shotguns, and auto shotguns as melee weapons.
    - Bullets and guns are affected by the object materials patch.
- Potion of Filth
  - Infects the user with terminal illness.
  - Not randomly generated.
- Footbow
  - Not randomly generated. Only found in the inventory of marrash.
  - Can only be effectively wielded by humanoids, since it requires the use of one's feet.
- Flaming Lash
  - Whip, deals 1d12 damage vs small and large.
  - Crumbles into dust when dropped.
  - Not randomly generated. Only found in the inventory of balrogs.

New Monsters
- Servals
  - Low-level cats that are capable of leaping.
  - Occasionally appear when trees are kicked.
  - Their tile image is utterly adorable.
- Werecats
  - Not randomly generated. Exist as a placeholder for the lycanthrope species.
- Marrashi
  - Dangerous gnoll species that appears in the mid to late game.
  - Equipped with a single filth-encrusted arrow, along with a footbow.
- Sphere of the Void
  - Slow-moving sphere with a disintegration attack.
  - Spawns hostile if the player has the amulet, but is otherwise peaceful.
- Armanite
  - Centuar-like demons that appear in large groups in Gehennom.
  - Due to their numbers and many attacks, often end up summoning many demons while attacking.

AI and Combat
- Monsters can light potions of oil, and hurl lit potions.
- Monsters will use wands of teleportation offensively.
- Monsters will not put on equipment when the player is directly next to them (from xNetHack).
- Monsters will fire ranged weapons in melee if they lack a hand-to-hand weapon.
- Remove monster charging mechanic.
- Changed the calculation for monsters firing ranged weapons at the hero, so that
  heroes with extremely low AC are still hit relatively often by arrows.
- Dual-wielding firearms is allowed, although at present it is not useful.
- Characters with a constitution score of greater than 12 no longer gain a bonus to hit
  point regeneration.
  - New players will not notice much of a difference, since accellerated regeneration only comes
    into play after level 10. Experienced players can no longer allow themselves to be surrounded
    with impunity, since they will no longer regenerate with such absurd speed.
  - Ideally, waiting for regeneration will be discouraged due to the lack of food in Gehennom.

Poison
- Weapons can now be poisoned with most types of potions, causing the potion to take
  effect upon hitting a creature. This feature stems from a similar feature in DNetHack.
  Unlike in DNetHack, a weapon can only have a single type of coating at once, and a weapon
  can be imbued with any type of potion.
  - Potion effects that occur via weapon always function as if the potion in question was cursed.
  - In extremely rare cases, monsters will generate with potion-soaked items.
  - Oiled weapons and projectiles create explosions of burning oil.
  - Sleeping potion = "drugged", sickness potion = "poisoned," potion of oil = "oiled," potion of
    paralysis = "envenomed," potion of filth = "filth-crusted," all other potions = "potion-soaked."
  - Dark elven arrows are always poisoned with sleeping potions.
  - As a consequence of this feature, some potions now have effects upon hitting the player or
    monsters. This includes potions of hallucination, gain level, and levitation.
- Just like DNetHack, many more types of weapons can be poisoned.

Shopkeepers
- Shopkeeper services, originally from SLASH'EM, are now available.
- Altered the appraisal service, since all weapon stats can be looked
  up in game.

Visual
- Tiled mode now includes an indicator to denote if a monster is part of a rider/steed
  pair.
- Added a new splash screen to the Windows build.
- Yellow lights and glowing dragons now emit quite a bit of light.

QOL
- Show the carrying capacity of a player and the number of slots in their
  inventory. This is originally sourced from FIQHack, then updated to 3.6
  in XNetHack, and then fixed in EvilHack. The 'i' inventory command now
  shows how full your inventory is, both in terms of weight/carrycap 
  and n/52 items.
- Improve monster and object lookup UI. The most significant change is adding
  headers to the information window, since it can sometimes be difficult to
  remember what information you are viewing. The other, more minor change is
  disabling the bolding in the monster display menu.
- Change the SpliceHack tip of the day to an engraving in the dust.
- Having earmuffs on will no longer cause enlightenment to display "sonic resistance."
- Display the number of times that the player has violated the celibate conduct
  in their conduct.
- Automatically display monster stats for monsters that the player looks at.
- Magic lamps always release a djinni when rubbed instead of 1/3 of the time. (from XNetHack)
- Martial arts users, sasquatches, and players wearing kicking boots can no
  longer miss a monster completely with a clumsy kick. (from XNetHack)
- Pets won't fight each other even if they grudge each other. (from XNetHack)
- Hallucination protects you against all gaze attacks made by monsters. (from XNetHack)
- All wands that print an unambiguous message clue to their identity now
  automatically type-identify when engraved with. (from XNetHack)
- Blessed stethoscopes can identify eggs (from XNetHack)

  - Bane of angels. Glows red in their presence.
  - Can paralyze monsters when hitting them.

- Dragonbane
  - Made of gold.
  - Warns the player of dragons.

    energy types, it is very possible to fire a disintegration ray.
- Sunsword
  - Made of crystal (+3 damage).
  - Warns the player of undead.
  - Is more effective, since nosferatu and Drauglir hate light as well.
- Trollsbane
  - Made of cold iron.
  - Warns the player of trolls.
  - Provides hungerless regeneration when wielded.
- Gae Dearg
  - Buffed damage and to-hit.
  - Fixed a bug where cancellation happened 1/9 times instead of 1/3 times.
- Gae Buidhe
  - Buffed damage.
- Gae Bulg
  - Buffed damage.
- Bradamante's Fury
  - Inflicts stun 1/10 times.
- Circe's Witchstaff
  - Can be invoked for taming.
- Seafoam
  - Change name to Poseidon's Trident
  - Invoking it grants water walking and causes an earthquake.
  - No longer erodeproof.

  - Altered to-hit and damage.

Species Changes
- Dwarf
  - Dwarves start all games with some booze.
  - Dwarves receive mattocks instead of picks in starting inventories.
- Ghoul
  - Ghouls can eat non-meat objects.
  - Ghouls, like convicts, can last twice as long at hungry and below.
  - Ghouls get stronger the hungrier they are, and do not suffer abuse penalties from being hungry.
    - When at least hungry, ghouls gain 4 strength and 4 dexterity.
    - When at least weak, ghouls deal double damage with their physical attacks.
    - When fainting, ghouls gain 2 strength, dexterity, wisdom, and intelligence.
  - Altered ability scores. Notably lowered strength cap to 16, which should incentivize players to
    stay hungry as much as possible.
- Angel
  - Angels receive several edicts upon starting the game:
    - Do not harm the innocent.
    - Do not steal.
    - Do not engage in amorous activities with demons.
  - Shopkeepers refer to the player as "Radiant One." Fallen angels are referred to as "fallen one."
  - Angels and fallen angels receive different messages upon beginning the game and upon ascending.
  - Angel flight is now sourced from creature form, rather than an intrinsic species trait.
  - Angels receive a halo during character creation. Halos provide 1 AC, and protection. it cannot
    be removed by the player, and it cannot be wished for or found in bones.
  - Breaking an edict causes the player to fall from grace. This has the following effects:
      - The player's halo, if any, is destroyed.
      - The player polymorphs into a fallen angel, meaning that they can no longer fly.
      - The player gains intrinsic unchanging.
      - In the endgame, fallen angels are accosted by archons, rather than sins.
  - Falling from grace can actually be a strategic option. Fallen angels have multiple weapon
    attacks, are always equal or greater to the level of the player when they fell, and the player
    can wear headgear other than halos.
- Lycanthrope
  - Player lycanthropes are now known as werecats, instead of werewolves.
  - Player lycanthropes never change into animal form randomly.
  - Player lycanthropes can use #monster to instantly transform.
  - Player lycanthropes have a strength of 25 in animal form.
  - Player lycanthropes only regenerate abnormally quickly when in animal form.
  - Player lycnthrope bite damage and HD scale with the level of the player.
- Changeling
  - Changelings now regenerate even when in their natural form.
  - Drastically lowered base stats.
  - Mechanic overhaul:
    - Chatting with a monster gives the changeling knowledge of that monster's form.
    - When using controlled polymorph, a changeling can, with 100% success, transform into any
      monster they have knowledge of, regardless of whether or not that creature is normally a valid
      polymorph form. Upon polymorphing, a changeling loses knowledge of that form, until a monster
      of that type is chatted with again.
    - Changelings can ONLY controlled polymorph into monsters whose forms they are familiar with.

Role Changes
- Archeologist
  - Allow chaotic archeologists. They start with two pistols, rather than a bullwhip and a fedora.
- Dragonmaster
  - All dragonmasters start with basic skill in riding.
  - Dragonmasters start with an intrinsic depending on the type of dragon they begin the game with.
- Cartomancer
  - Any monster killed by a cartomancer has a 50% chance of dropping as a spell card.
  - Fading monsters summoned by scrolls remain for a much shorter period of time.
  - Updated summon card naming.
- Knight
  - Allow chaotic knights.

Gehennom
- When in Gehennom, randomly generated monsters will be automatically converted to their hellish
  counterparts, if any. For example, bears become hellbears, and sewer rats become hellrats.
- Monsters DO NOT leave corpses in Gehennom.
- Rearranged Gehennom to be closer to vanilla, and shortened main dungeon back to
  the length of vanilla.

Miscelaneous
- Kicking a tree has a chance of spawning a serval or (very rarely) a jaguar.
- All mindless monsters resist all sources of psychic damage.
- Remove artifact chants.
- Pazuzu no longer leaves a corpse.
- Hunger hulks provide a single point of nutrition. Since they take several turns to
  eat, eating a hunger hulk corpse will actually make you hungrier. Fantastic YANI
  from aosdict.
- Prevent boulders from being pushed while running (RojjaCebolla)
- Randomize orienation on game start.
- Allow gnomish tourists, vampiric knights, gnomish samurai.
- Dynamically assign a gender to "lord" and "king" monsters, and change their 
  names based on gender.
- Vampire mages and ogre mages can now be female.
- Balrog have been made much more threatening.
  - Balrog leave behind a cloud of smoke when they move.
  - Balrog spawn with a flaming lash, and will prioritize wielding it.
- Being deaf does not make you resistant to sonic attacks.
- War hammers deal d12 damage, instead of d4, buffing both Giantslayer and Mjollnir.
- Bell of opening reverted to a silver bell.
- Vorpal Jabberwocks now behead, similar to how they do in UnNetHack.
- Piranhas now eat corpses.
- Improve monster callout noises.

Bug Fixes
- Correctly track the celibate conduct.
- Correctly track sokoban guilt when liquid leaping.
- Override beehive wall color in the wizard's tower.
- All vampiric monsters are harmed by silver, including the player and vampiric mind
  flayers, which in previous versions were unaffected.
- Fixed a few double livelog issues which could affect public servers.
- Fixed a bad mplayer panic when spawning a convict player monster.
- Fixed an impossible when spawning shambling horrors.
- Minor potion of reflection feedback fix.
- Fixed an enormous number of memory issues and crashes (thanks to Demo).

  throwing weapons.
- Fixed segfault caused by vanishing monsters.
- Prevented cartomancer grinding via killing fading monsters repeatedly.
- Do not count births of fading monsters.
- Many fixes for the object materials patch.
- Locusts can no longer consume an entire pile of objects in a single turn. They can,
  however, still consume bags.

Sounds
- Add more sounds for monsters fighting than just noises in the distance.
- Add sounds for dilapidated armories, since they are dangerous enough that
  they deserver a warning.
- Add a message for talking to Marids.

                            Version 0.7.1

3.7.0
- SpliceHack is now up to date with the development version of NetHack 3.7.0.
- Due to the sweeping changes made by 3.7.0, many bugs are likely to have been
  introduced. At the same time, merging 3.7.0 required a careful examination
  of almost every file, leading to bug fixes for many unreported issues.
- Due to the addition of vanilla's version of the flipped levels patch, more
  levels are eligible for flipping, and less bugs should occur when exploring
  a flipped level.
- Splice-specific rooms and dungeon features are now supported in special levels,
  thanks to the release of the new level coder.
- Temporarily disabled random light status in car-loca due to lack of implementation
  for random lighting in lua.
- Dropped the castle and knox variants. They are not widely liked, and it seemed
  easier just not to port them.
- Changed the ill-fated option to illfated.

User Friendliness / QOL Features
- Added numerous database entries. Most creatures should now have some sort
  of entry associated.
- Magma elementals and storm elementals only spawn in Gehennom.
  - People have complained about these blocking access to dungeon corridors, and it makes thematic
    sense for them to appear in Gehennom, at which point the player has methods to bypass magma.
- Merfolk can be valkyrie.
- Lit corridors defaults to "On."

New Monsters
- New Monster: Thriae
  - Does not appear until the player is powerful enough to deal with them, but can be potentially
    very nasty when summoned via summon insects, such as in the endgame.
- New Monster: Orc Warlord
  - Not randomly generated. Grown up form of an orc captain. The leader of the orctown gang has been
    changed to an orc warlord.
- New Monster: Guard Dog
  - Dog counterpart to fat cats.
- New Monster: Mud Elemental
  - Mud Elementals are not randomly generated. They only appear when an earth elemental is zapped
    with a wand of water, or as a minion of a neutral deity or angel.
- New Monster: Ice Elemental
  - Ice Elementals are not randomly generated. They appear only when as a neutral minion.
- New Monster: Chicken
  - Chickens originally appear in SLASH'EM, and have been tweaked slightly for spliceHack. Yes, I
    take chickens very seriously.
      - All chickens are now female, can fly, and can lay eggs.
      - Chickens now use domestic coloring, in order to distinguish them from cockatrices.
      - The chicken tile has been tweaked, so that it looks better.
      - Chicken sounds have been fleshed out and debugged.
      - Attacking one chicken angers all chickens within sight.
- New Monster: Pig
  - Domestic and omnivorous, but make for poor pets.
  - Instantly eat all organic objects.
  - YAFM for pulling pigs out of pits.
- New Monster: Werephant
  - It's a were-elephant. I'm not sorry.
  - Unintentionally YAFM: "The werephant turns into a phant."
- New Monster: Winter Wolf Pup
  - Not randomly generated. Pets for Valkyries.
- New Monster: Pazuzu
  - Demon prince, can be summoned by other demons.
  - Always starts out as peaceful and asks the player for a bribe, unlike other unique demons.
- New Monster: Killer Mimic
  - Unlike other mimics, the killer mimic can bite, and is decently fast.
- New Monster: Selkie
  - Dangerous amphibious horse.
  - Can drown the player and drain life.
- New Monster: Goristro
  - Demonic minotaur; spawns randomly in Gehennnom.
  - Occasionally appears in hellish mazes in place of minotaurs.
- New Monster: Myconid Scout
- New Monster: Myconid Warrior
- New Monster: Myconid Reaver
- New Monster: Myconid Elder
  - A group of fungus class monsters. Their presence in later levels makes loitering around and
    letting corpses mold over a bad idea.
  - Myconid warriors and elders can infest nearby corpses, creating more myconid warriors.
- Slash'Em Monster: Arc Bug
- Slash'Em Monster: Spark Bug
- Slash'Em Monster: Lightning Bug
  - Ported from Slash'em for increased early game challenge.
  - Unlike Slash'em these bugs can only move horizontally. This change was made to foster more
    strategic play early, and to offset the danger of these bugs.
- EvilHack / SporkHack Monster: Locust
  - Taken from EvilHack / SporkHack.
  - Tile updated to distinguish it from other instects.
  - Eats organic items, and multiplies whenever it does.
- EvilHack / SporkHack Monster: Magical Eye
  - Extremely dangerous, even in the late game.
- New Monster: Lawyer
  - Hits the player with various law effects.

New Monsters (Less Notable)
- New Monster: Ulsfark
- New Monster: Ronin
- New Monster: Ancient Thornswell
- New Monster: Necromancer
- New Monster: Dark Knight
  - All of these monsters are not randomly generated, and generally only encountered via polytraps.
- New Monster: Changeling Mummy
- New Monster: Changeling Zombie
  - Both relatively unremarkable, aside from being shapeshifters. They are not randomly generated,
    and generally appear in bones files.

New Items
- New Item: Wand of Water
  - Wands of water do a small amount of damage and will damage armor. zapping a wand of water at a
    monster that likes fire will deal a very large amount of damage, zapping a water elemental will
    heal it, and zapping an earth elemental will turn it into a mud elemental.
- New Item: Scroll of Elementalism
  - Sourced from the Lethe Patch, with some minor changes. First, the scroll is read less liberally
    by monsters, monsters no longer randomly spawn with is as their defensive item, and the scroll
    can create any type of elemental except fusion elementals.
  - Additionally, partially de-spaghettified the code for summoning elementals.
- New Item: Ring of Sickness Resistance
- New Item: Horn of Blasting
  - Functions like a frost or fire horn, but releases sonic energy instead.
  - Examining it reveals its subclass as "theoretically tonal instrument."
- New Item: Lute
  - Starting musical instrument.
  - Hard to play, but has a chance of removing confusion.
- New Item: Bagpipes
  - Starting musical instrument.
  - It aggravates monsters, unless you play well, in which case it exercises charisma.
- New Items: Stomping Boots
  - Attacking a very small monster while wearing stomping boots will instantly kill it.
  - You cannot randomly escape traps while wearing stomping boots.
  - Stomping on a monster wakes up all nearby monsters, so they cannot be used to casually stomp
    through an anthole or beehive with impunity.
  - Jumping while wearing stomping boots allows you to stomp on very small monsters in your path and
    continue onward, making the boots somewhat useful for dealing with hordes of insects on the
    astral plane. Jumping on a monster while hallucinating yields YAFM.
- New Item: Sewing Kit
  - Can repair cloth and leather items.

New Special Materials
- Adamantine
  - Exceedingly rare and expensive. 
  - Adamantine armor has a higher than normal AC bonus. 
  - Edged adamantine weapons deal +3 damage.
- Cold Iron
  - Sears fey for +1d20 damage.
  - Vulnerable to rust, but immune to corrosion.
- Shadowspun
  - Does not impact spellcasting.
  - Weighs practically nothing.
  - Functions normally against shades.
- Crystal
  - Like EvilHack, gemstone material items are referred to as "crystal" in game.
  - Edged crystal weapons deal +3 damage.

Species Changes
- New Species: Changeling
  - #chat to a monster to polymorph into it. The monster's base level must be of no more than three
    levels higher than the player, and requires a large amount of energy.
  - Do not passively gain hit points without a special source of regeneration, unless polymorphed.
  - Hate iron in their natural form.
- Player werewolves gain massive strength when morphed. There have apparently been
  rumors that you will break out of your armor, which are false.
- Ghouls can use sewing kits to sew a monster corpse onto themselves. On a critical
  hit, they gain additional attacks as if they are that monster, but get hungrier. 

New Traps
- New Trap: Ice Block Trap
  - Deals cold damage.
  - If the player does not have free action and fails a dex save, they are temporarily paralyzed.
  - Can appear on chests.
  - Does not generate in Gehennom.

Misc. Changes
- Circe's Witchstaff only transforms monsters into pigs now.
- Many monsters are capable of charging at the player from a distance, allowing
  them to cover large distances quickly.
- Valkyries begin the game with a pet winter wolf pup.
- There is a one in six chance that an efreet will emerge from a lamp, instead of
  a djinni.

- High Priests resist death.

- Majorly buffed scrolls of web. A single scroll of web allows a player to place
  many webs.
- Manticores are much, much more dangerous. Instead of firing a single spike that
  does barely any damage, they fire a volley of painful spikes at enemies.
- Buffed giant praying mantises, giant flies, skunks, kangaroos, tasmanian devils,
  mad alchemists, cerastes, amphisbaena, and lemurs. All should be more of a
  challenge.

  the regular dungeon.

  the relevant monster size changes from XNetHack, as well as a few changes to specific
  SpliceHack monsters.

  Now, nothing can follow you to the black market.
- Implemented a partial fix for the monster weapon switching bug.

- Fixed transmuters not updating inventory correctly.
- Fixed demon lords being con artists, and demanding money from the player 
  several times in a row.

  the banquet hall incredibly drunk, and allowing for booze exploits.

Known Bugs:
- Genociding or killing a monster steed before the rider will result in some odd, 
  but not game-breaking behavior.
- Nonbinary players should be referred to correctly in all instances, but it is
  possible that I missed something in the 3.7 merge. Please, let me know.


                    Version 0.7.0: Stranger Days

Roles, Species, and Character Creation
- Sexual Orientation
  - Sexual orientation affects whether you are seduced by succubi, incubi, both, or neither.
  - Options are gay, lesbian, bisexual, and asexual.
  - Please note that this is an experimental implementation, and as such only a few orientations are
    included, and the in-game representation may not be a perfect reflection of real life.
    This is a work in progress.
  - Sexual orientation is defined in the rc file.
- Nonbinary Gender
  - Resolved numerous bugs and corner cases which would cause the player to be referred to
    incorrectly. Nonbinary characters should be referred to with they/them pronouns in all cases.
  - Nonbinary characters are more likely to receive prompts on armor removal via foocubus.
  - Nonbinary characters cannot lay eggs.
  - Eggs hatched in the inventory of nonbinary characters always hatch peaceful monsters.

  - Dwarf Ranger
  - Dwarf Wizard
  - Elf Healer
  - Elf Rogue
  - Drow Rogue
  - Orc Monk
  - Orc Pirate
  - Orc Priest
  - Gnome Pirate
  - Gnome Rogue
- New Species: Vampire
  - Ported vampires from Slash'em.
  - The species is fully intact, although this was far harder to port to 3.6.x than any other piece
    of code I have encountered.
  - Vampires have a few additional roles available.
- New Role: Convict
  - Added the Convict Patch, originally written by Karl Garrison. The convict role is now fully
    3.6.x compatible.
- Dragonmaster Changes 
  - Dragonmasters now start with a random type of pet dragon (except black).
  - Dragonmasters can no longer eat dragons without it being considered cannibalism. In exchange,
    they gain intrinsics on level up. This is from SliceHack.
- Cartomancer Changes
  - Every time a cartomancer kills a monster, there is a 1/20 chance that a spell card of create
    monster drops instead of a corpse. This card 
    (unless cursed) will summon a tame version of the monster to fight by the side of the player.
  - Cartomancers start with create monster scrolls keyed to random monsters.
  - Cartomancers can use decks of cards as if blessed.
- Merfolk Changes

  by fire.

- Additional sounds and YAFMS for chatting with various monsters.
- Monsters in the endgame attempt to find altars to sacrifice the amulet on
  if they manage to steal it.
- Masks are generated randomly from the list of monsters, making the chance 
  of obtaining a useful mask much higher.
- Track the celibate conduct.
- Withering status effect. Blocks normal HP regeneration, and causes the
  player to lose 1 HP per turn. Having regeneration and withering at the
  same time nullifies HP regeneration, but there is no HP loss over time.

Fixes
- Purple dragons breathe "A wave of pure sound" instead of merely breathing
  sonic.
- Switched to using aosdict's fix for object probabilities over 1000.
- Holographic Void Lily has correctly attributed effects, and no longer
  relies on a massive kludge in order to function.
- Expensive cameras used by monsters will hurt players that are polymorphed into
  light-hating monsters.
- Fixed boabhan-sith spawning as random monsters.
- Fixed inconsistent cause of death across livelog, top ten list, and gravestone
  when receiving a random death message.

  shapeshift.

- Fixed a bug where turning undead as a knight would consistently fail.
- Switched psychic rays color from blue to magenta.

Balance Changes
- Pull Under now has a failure rate, so that players do not use it to reliably
  slay boss monsters. The higher your level and the lower the monster's level,
  the more likely it is for the attack to succed.
- Scrolls of time cause the reader to become more hungry, and grant less
  movement points. This is in order to prevent abuse in the endgame.
- Nerfed Banshees. Previously, they bypassed fixed abilities and deafness,
  and could sap an endgame character's strength in only a few turns.
- Gae Bulg disappears with 100% certainty after successfully being thrown to 
  kill a monster. This event is livelogged if playing on a public server.
- Scrolls of scare monster no longer have any effect on unique monsters.

                    Version 0.6.4: Broken Things

Features
- New sounds for birds. They now let you know if you are abusing them.
- New monster gaze attacks implemented for polymorphed players.
- Changed how amalgamations and bad clones function.
    - This was a difficult but necessary decision. Amalgamations and bad clones were too buggy and
      poorly implemented to continue on as they were. They now function as regular monsters, but
      occasionally use the attacks of random, level-appropriate monsters in place of their own.
      Hopefully this system is less frustrating.

New Monsters
- Molydeus:
    - Molydei are one of the most dangerous monsters in the game. They are high level, and able to
      dish out a lot of damage with their greataxes.
    - Any creature hit by their bite attack has a chance of being polymorphed into a manes. Poison
      resistance reduces the chance of this occurring, but will not prevent it. The only way to
      truly be safe is to be unchanging.
    - In order to balance them, they cannot summon any type of demon through hell-p, just more
      manes.
    - If a player polymorphs into one, all demon lords will be automatically hostile to them.
    - Due to their abilities, Molydei are one of the best choices for pets. conversely, they are one
      of the most dangerous to your own pets.
- Hippo
    - Hippos are fairly unremarkable. They yawn when angry, just like real hippos. They are also
      dangerous and aggressive, just like real hippos.

Bug Fixes
- Numerous fixes to monster steeds.
- Fixed Dal Zethire instantly dying.
- Alucard no longer begins polymorphed, which should fix the bad weapon restore
  errors players were running into during Junethack.
- Many other fixes.

                    Version 0.6.3: Junethack Ahoy!

Features
- Modified XNetHack / SLASH'EM fungus growth. Generating mold warriors is
  highly unlikely.
- Addition of G_PLANES and G_NOPLANES tags. The SLASH'EM angels and devas
  can only be generated in the planes. Marids no longer generate in the planes.
  This should allow greater control over the late game, and hopefully make the
  planes feel a little bit more distinctive.
- Began selectively implementing maps and features from the Lethe patch.

Special Rooms
- Added L's Dilapidated Armory Patch.
- Improved abandoned laboratories.
- Reduced frequency of felines in dens.

New Items
- Spiked Chains: Combine the best features of polearms and melee weapons. This
  is a reference to D&D 3.5, where spiked chains are horrifyingly broken.
- Encyclopedias: Contain identities of several items.


New Monsters
- From SLASH'EM:
    - Movanic Deva
    - Mondadic Deva
    - Astral Deva
    - Planetar
    - Solar
- Zuggotomoy
    - Zuggotomoy's passive attack does random elemental damage, and she can infest corpses to create
      aspects of herself. She is extremely dangerous, but has no lair as of yet.
- Aspect of Zuggotomoy

Bug Fixes
- Stabilized amalgamations and gels.
- Various other fixes.
- Fixed numerous issues with ghouls.

Features
- YAFM for getting killed by a T-Rex.

- Wands of windstorm identify when zapped, and monsters are less likely to use
  them to stunlock the player.
- Junk shops: Junk shops sell a variety of "junk items"

Tiles
- SpliceHack is now 100% tiles-compatible, and tested as such! Rejoice!

Nonbinary Characters
- Characters can now be nonbinary! For now, this is largely cosmetic, as the
  game treats them like female characters. This will change in the future once
  there is feedback on what differences should exist.
- As a side-effect, many roles are renamed for nonbinary characters, such as
  "Caveperson" and "Magister."

Patches Introduced
- Updated XNetHack object materials patch.
- Livelogging of players killing their own pet (XNetHack).

Balance Changes
- Scroll writing costs have been adjusted in order to cut down on abuse of
  scrolls of knowledge and time. Previous strategies with a magic marker
  involved writing a half-dozen scrolls of knowledge, identifying everything
  one would need for the rest of the game, and then writing a ton of time
  scrolls to breeze through Astral. Scrolls of time are as expensive to write
  as genocide, while scrolls of knowledge cannot be written at all.
- Ported FIQHack's XP Curve, resulting in more leveling up during the endgame.
- Monster application of figurines now functions more similarly to how the
  player applies figurines, meaning that the monsters generated are not always
  aggressive.
- Helms of Opaque Thoughts now block mind flayer attacks to the head.
- Rings of Memory prevent forgetting spells over time.
- Will-o'-wisps nerfed again.

- Spectres only generate when the player is level 15 or above now.
- Reflective monsters do not chug potions of reflection.
- Hurtling into a wall no longer paralyzes you for the duration of your would-be
  hurtle. This prevents wind monsters from being able to stunlock enemies
  against walls.

Role and Species Changes
- Cartomancers can identify the rarity of various cards.
- The lycanthrope species functions very similarly to SLASH'EM's werewolf now.

Dungeon Changes
- Gehennom is now extremely compact, and the second fake wizard's tower is gone.
- The main branch of the dungeon is ten levels longer, and you can encounter a
  big room up to three times.
- The first level of Vlad's tower includes a massive courtyard and is guarded by
  Alucard.
- The void has been reworked. It still contains a void dragon and dangerous 
  monsters, but now holds portals to many different points across the dungeon.
  You cannot use this to bypass the ascension run, so don't even think about it.

New Monsters
- Ported shambling horrors from Unnethack. Given the numerous damage types in
  SpliceHack, they can end up being absolutely ridiculous.
- Lots of Bears:
  - Bear
  - Drop Bear
  - Hellbear
  - Werebear

  - Nonbinary player monsters (various)

New Objects
- Aligned scrolls have been replaced with scrolls of air, warp weapon, and warp
  material, all of which are infinitely more interesting and more useful.
- Medical Kits and associated items from SLASH'EM. Pills cannot grant wishes, so
  don't even think about it.
- Potions of blood and vampire blood from SLASH'EM. Non-vampires can chuck blood
  at you, if they somehow manage to get ahold of it.

Miscellaneous Changes
- Powerful unique monsters now get fullscreen entrance messages.
- Refactored demon glyph colors so they are easier to tell apart.
- Additional tips, t-shirts, epitaphs, and the like.
- Monsters use many more items, such as potions of blood, booze, and expensive
  cameras.
- Weapons can be named after players on the high score list.
- Several YAFMs.
- Scrolls of knowledge yield much more intelligible messages.

- Tourist player monsters spawn with expensive cameras, and knights are
  automatically mounted on ponies.

- Pets avoid eating chameleons.

  initial release of SpliceHack.

- Dragonmasters no longer get crashes when their steeds attempt to free them
  from a monster's stomach.

  intended.
- Fixed many improper weapon damage bonuses.

- Fixed ooze dragons and razor dragons dropping the wrong scales.
- Malcanthet no longer spontaneously renames herself.
- Too many others to count.


                    Version 0.5.0 - Balance and the Bizarre

Patches Introduced
- SpliceHack now uses xnethack's object materials patch.
- SpliceHack uses xnethack's randomly named weapons, originally ported from
  NetHack Fourk. SpliceHack's version functions differently, however, and
  generates a different set of names.

Balance Changes
- Nerfed lamassu damage output.
- Nerfed amalgamations slightly. Additionally, amalgamations now use a
  completely different and much better naming system that fits in the game
  more naturally.
- Disabled dungeon crumbling feature. This may be reinstated upon feedback.
- The demon lords that appear due to performing the ritual are no longer
  covetous, preventing the player from being mobbed and randomly killed during
  the ascension.
- Nerfed psionic attacks so that they no longer confuse the player.
- The lord of the foocubi is now renamed to Malcanthet, and has been heavily
  nerfed.

Role and Species Changes
- Infernals use their own species tag, which changes their class selection
  slightly.
- Silver items generate more often for infernal characters, making the role
  much more harrowing to play.
- Infernals are now fire resistant instead of having infravision.
- Pirates no longer always get a message about rising as skeletal pirates.
- Cartomancers use a refactored language system.

Dungeon Changes
- New branch: Ice wastes. A creepy level covered in ice and snow, with an orb
  of permafrost at the end. This level is important in that it also has a
  guaranteed pair of earmuffs, so it is much easier to find something for
  sonic resistance during a run.
- New branch: Mysterious laboratory. This laboratory is run by mind flayers, and
  they are not thrilled to be interrupted. The level contains numerous
  spellbooks as loot.

New Monsters (12)
- Failure Eidolon, a unique monster appearing in the ice wastes. It can
  teleport the player.
- Ancient Brain, a unique monster appearing in the laboratory. It cannot move,
  but can fire psychic rays and cast spells.
- Cheshire cats. They are very rare and only spawn in Gehennom. They have
  displacement, and making them invisible gives YAFM.
- Ported SLASH'EM's Zouthern animals, of which there are eight. Some of these
  animals have had their damage output nerfed from SLASH'EM in order to match
  the balance of SpliceHack.

New Objects (3)
- Orb of permafrost, an orb that causes an icy explosion when thrown.
- Spellbooks of flame sphere and freeze sphere, which function nearly
  identically to SLASH'EM. These necessitated changing the AI for explosive pets
  slightly.

Miscelaneous Changes
- All monsters can potentially gain intrinsics by eating, not just pets. This
  makes gelationous cubes and tasmanian devils slightly more dangerous since
  they consume everything in their path.
- Monsters can now use magic flutes and rarely drums of earthquake.
- Updated the database with many new monsters.
- YAFM when a tornado engulfs a Cartomancer (Luxidream).
- Pets now produce a message when they level up.
- Ants now have a special sound when #chatted with.
- Added a few more monsters to summon nasties.
- Monsters that can jump now notify you when you polymorph into them.
- Changed the piece of cloth into a dusty cloak (xnethack).
- Looking at a monster no longer displays whether they are armored, but does
  tell you the material of their weapon.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed doors being rendered in the wrong color.
- Updated to current version of vanilla NetHack.
- Fixed health food stores causing segfaults (msearle5).
- Monsters with steeds and ridden monsters no longer follow you to other levels,
  thus preventing several segfaults and bugs.
- Spellcasters with no arms no longer point at you before cursing.
- Fixed some monster sound bugs.
- Monsters now actually attempt to throw their throwing axes.
- Fixed legendary lichen corpses being treated differently than lichens.
- Fixed silver haters being gifted silver artifacts.
- Fixed silver haters starting the game with silver items. The items in their
  inventory are set to iron instead of silver, regardless of the type. This is
  a kludge.
- Fixed overly powerful reaver, and a few erroneous damage values for weapons.
- Fixed a lot of black market related bugs, including continual guards and
  thiefbane not being wielded. This means that One-Eyed Sam now wears a cloak
  of reflection and hex dragon scale mail.
- Fixed amalgamations bugging out when engulfing.

Known Bugs
- Pets can be taken into the Black Market, but not out of it.
- Some species are improperly tagged.

                    Version 0.4.0 - QOL and Life Improvement

Major Patches
- Implemented a heavily modified version of the descriptive hit messages patch
  by L, and combined it with SpliceHack's existing monk hit messages.
- Changes from NetHack 3.6.2B were pulled into the game.
- Chris's Pirate patch was implemented, thus adding the pirate role to the game.
  Updating this to be compatible with 3.6.1 took quite a bit of work, so for
  those trying to add it to 3.6.1 I would recommend looking at what I did here.
- Added the Black Market from Unnethack/SLASHEM, using the code in Unnethack.
  The market functions largely the same as the one in SLASHEM, although there
  are a few small differences due to porting the code from 3.4.3 to 3.6.x
  (see below).
- Implemented an altered version of the colored walls and floors patch by L.
  Only walls are colored, and the Valley of the Dead is not in grayscale. In
  addition, some branches have new wall colors.

QOL Changes
- Dropped the quest entry requirement to level 10.
- Ported paranoid trap and swim confirmation from xnethack.
- Ported peaceful monster displacement from xnethack.
- Ported NAO 3.4.3's hilite_hidden_stairs option to 3.6.x and SpliceHack.
  Defaults to true.
- Artifact wishing is based on the number of artifacts wished for, not
  generated, preventing the increased  number of artifacts from nerfing artifact
  wishing.
- The vibrating square can now be teleported onto directly (YANI by Mandevil)
- New messages when monsters pursue you up or down dungeon levels (YANI by
  aosdict)
- There are now messages for triggering teleport and level teleport traps.
- Void level disabled (for now).
- Looking at monsters provides additional information, such as whether they can
  jump or be domesticated.

Balance Changes
- Nerfed Lord of the Foocubi and Will-o'-the-wisps after player feedback.
- Nerfed mind flayer telepath damage.
- Only dragons can randomly roar now, as opposed to any monster with MS_ROAR.
- Reduced the number of marids and giant eels on the plane of water.
- Monsters can only get wishes from smoky potions now, not wands of
  wishing. Wishes for wands of death and archon figurines were removed.
- Several artifacts were buffed. The most noticeable buff is to dismounter,
  which now does extra damage and throws a rider from their horse, making them
  automatically stunned. This is particularly useful against the new riders.
- Luckless Folly now must be wished for, and will probably be added as a prize
  for a branch at some point.
- Amalgamtions now grab totally random monsters to make a part of themselves.
  For balance purposes, their speed has been massively nerfed. Regardless,
  tangle with them at your own peril.

New Monsters (21, but only 8 spawn randomly)
- Ported Gnolls, Gnoll Shamans, and Gnoll Chieftains from SLASH'EM.
- Added Lampades, high-level nymphs appearing in Gehennom.
- Added Pack Lords, which transform into Alpha Werewolves. Alpha Werewolves
  transmit regular lycanthropy, and can (rarely) summon normal werewolves.
- Added ratmen and mutated ratmen. Both are low-level monsters that spawn
  randomly.
- Headless horseman, a demon that spawns riding a nightmare.
- A pale horse, white horse, and black horse, which only appear on the Astral
  Plane and are ridden by their respective Riders.
- The pirate patch adds damned pirates, skeletal pirates, parrots, Mayor
  Cumberbund, Blackbeard's Ghost, pirates, pirate brothers, and planar pirates.
  These are not usually encountered unless one is a pirate.
- One-Eyed Sam the Arms Dealer runs the Black Market.

New Objects (4)
- Ring of Blood Magic: If you do not have enough energy to cast a spell, you
  cast it anyway, but lose hit points equal to the excess energy. Casting
  healing spells using blood magic will deal extra damage to you in order to
  prevent skill farming.
- Ring of Psychic Resistance: One of the few ways in the game to become
  resistant to psionic attacks.
- Ring of Memory: Blocks the forgetting of items, spells, and objects.
  Essentially amnesia resistance.
- Scrolls of Knowledge: Essentially scrolls of reverse identify, like those
  that appear in Nethack, the Next Generation. Reading one will allow you to
  identify any item in the game by prompt.

New Artifacts (4)
- Chest of Proteus: The pirate quest artifact. Catches curses and occasionally
  polymorphs the items placed inside it. The polypiler's dream.
- Reaver: An artifact scimitar. The crowning gift for pirates.
- Marauder's Map: An artifact scroll of magic mapping. Sacrifice gift for
  pirates. Can also be invoked to detect artifacts.
- Thiefbane: Wielded by One-Eyed Sam. Identical to Thiefbane in Unnethack.

New Features
- Pets can gain intrinsics by eating corpses.
- Monsters can have Water Walking.
- Monsters can have Displacement. A displaced monster has a 1/4
  chance of being someplace else when it is melee-d, and then surprising you.
  Displacement can be bypassed using see invisible or telepathy. This feature is
  subject to change on player feedback.
- Monsters can jump. This essentially allows them to do a short range teleport
  to the player if there is an available jumping path.
- All monsters can now gain displacement, water walking, and jumping from
  appropriate items.
- Monsters can ride steeds.

Role and Species Changes
- Chromatic dragons are treated as domestic for Dragonmasters, meaning (among
  other things) that they can be tamed.
- Dragonmasters slowly regenerate energy when standing next to pet dragons.
  Additionally, pet dragons will attempt to help a dragonmaster who is slimed,
  asleep, or stuck.
- As noted above, the pirate role is now available.

Miscelaneous Changes and Bug Fixes
- Fixed the alignment of monsters being compared incorrectly when seeing whether
  they would sacrifice something on an altar.
- Fixed a segfault relating to monsters being gifted a nonexistent item from an
  altar.
- Fixed monsters not picking up corpses to sacrifice. All of these fixes make
  monster sacrifice on altars much more likely to occur, especially in minetown.
- Landsharks are no longer slithy.
- Martial artists and martial masters use monk hit messages.
- Landsharks and Jumping Spiders are capable of jumping. Polymorphing into
  either of these monsters will grant the ability to jump.
- Completely reworked Mephisto's lair.
- The Grim Reaper is now drain resistant.
- Earmuffs are now referred to as "a pair of earmuffs" instead of "earmuff,"
  fixing one of the longest running bugs in SpliceHack.
- Game pluralizes "worm that walks" as "worms that walk," as opposed to the
  Gollum-esque "worms that walkses."
- Psychic and sonic resistance now appear in the enlightenment menu.
- Permanent versus temporary hallucination is now displayed correctly based on
  roleplay options.
- Added a few random god names.
- Added new sounds for pirates, all zombies, cows, and giant flies.
- Due to the way that shopkeepers changed from 3.4.3 to 3.6.x, simply using
  PM_ONE_EYED_SAM results in (at best), "One-Eyed Sam the One-Eyed Sam", and
  segfaults due to shopkeeper struct initialization at worst. Thus, she now
  uses the Arms Dealer monster entry.
- Domestic birds can now fly, as they were supposed to be able to.
- Riders now carry their appropriate implements, and resurrect with special
  messages.
- Merfolk are generated hostile now, so killing them no longer counts as
  murder.
- Mind flayer telepaths are now treated as mind flayers.
- Magma elementals no longer say that they dissolved into magma without
  actually dissolving into magma.
- Silver dragons and baby silver dragons no longer quaff potions of reflection.
- Desert jinn no longer leave corpses.
- Fixed a bug where enlightenment could not be duplicated by a wand of wonder.
- Fixed amalgamations rarely randomly segfaulting on initialization.

Known Bugs
- Currently, it is possible to take your pet into the black market, but not
  back out. I know why this bug exists but have not been able to solve it.
